## Introduction

This project was designed by myself and three other students (Zack Palantzas, Corey Szeto and Aleem Haq) using primarily C++. We also used Blender to create the models for the actual chess pieces. 

## What

The game is a fully functioning two player chess game. It allows players to perform for all correct movements. It has multiple features that enhance user experience nad playability. And we even added a little flare to make the game look fun and enjoyable!
